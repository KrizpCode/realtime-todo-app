# Realtime To-Do application

A Realtime To-Do application where users can register an account, create to-do lists and share with other users.
All of the changes within a to-do list happens in realtime, and invited users can work on the same list simultaneously.

## Frameworks

### Frontend:
* React
* GraphQL
* TypeScript

### Backend:
* Node with Express
* GraphQL
* TypeScript
* WebSockets

### Other

## Current features of my application
* A user is able to create an account
* A user is able to log-in with their created account
* A user can update the e-mail/password of their account
* A user can reset their password and get an email with instructions in how to do so.
* A user can create an infinite number of To-Do lists with custom names.
* A user can share their list with another registered user.
* A user can add/remove/update to-do's to their To-Do list in realtime. (The changes will be viewed by other registered users to this list as well and vice versa)


For this project I set a goal to learn TypeScript, GraphQL and FireBase.
If I were to continue developing this app, I would add a database, a way to filter the lists by active/done/all, and add special lists with different special features.
