## Implemented User-Stories:
* I as a user can create to-do items, such as a grocery list.

* I as another user can collaborate in real-time with user - so that we can
(for example) edit our family shopping-list together.

* I as a user can mark to-do items as “done” - so that I can avoid clutter and focus on
things that are still pending.

* I as a user can create multiple to-do lists where each list has it's unique URL that I can
share with my friends - so that I could have separate to do lists for my groceries and work
related tasks.

## Frameworks

### Frontend:
* React
* GraphQL
* TypeScript

### Backend:
* Node with Express
* GraphQL
* TypeScript
* WebSockets

For this project I set a goal to learn TypeScript and more of GraphQL, and I learned a lot along the way. If I would to continue developing this app, I would add a database, a way to filter the lists by active/done/all, and add special lists with different special features.
